# The Effects of Vein Morphology on Elastic Wing Deformation
This repository contains the research work conducted by Yosef Mendelson under the supervision of Dr. Gal Ribak at the School of Zoology in collaboration with the School of Engineering, Tel Aviv University.

## Abstract
Unlike flying vertebrates, insect flight relies on the passive, elastic deformation of their wings to generate lift. This study focuses on understanding how vein morphology and wing flexural rigidity impact wing deformation and lift generation.

## Objectives
- Assess the implications of flexural stiffness on wing deformation.
- Understand the aerodynamic influences of different vein morphologies.

## Methodology
- Synthetic replication of Protaetia cuprea wings with modified veinal networks.
- High-speed camera analysis and lift force measurements using a custom flapper device.

## Key Findings
- Vein cross-sectional area directly affects wing rigidity and deformation capabilities.
- Insights into important factors for synthetic remodeling of flapping wings.
